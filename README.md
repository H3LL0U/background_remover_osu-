Were you wondering how you can remove the backgrounds entirely from all the maps in osu! ?

This program should help you fix this issue by (at the moment) deleting all the background images from all the map folders that you have.

#TODO:
add a system that stores maps instead of deleting them so that you can switch between having backgrounds and not having them

make the auto-search run asynchronosly, so that nothing freezes while it's searching for the osu!/Songs folder

complete the GUI and add other functionality

#Known issues:
The current build might trigger some antiviruses since they consider files of the PyInstaller to be malicious.
