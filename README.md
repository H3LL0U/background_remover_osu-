Were you wondering how you can remove the backgrounds entirely from all the maps in osu! ?

This program should help you fix this issue by (at the moment) deleting all the background images from all the map folders that you have.

#TODO:
add a system that stores maps instead of deleting them so that you can switch between having backgrounds and not having them

complete the GUI and add other functionality
