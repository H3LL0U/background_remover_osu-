Were you wondering how you can remove the backgrounds entirely from all the maps in osu! ?

This program can help you fix this issue by (at the moment) deleting all the background images from all the map folders that you have.


How does it work?
You can download the repo and open the executable in the build folder.
From there you can select the osu!/Songs folder where all of your songs files are located.
(You can do it manually by pressing the Manual search button or let the app find the possible location for you by pressing the auto search button)
if you selected the right folder all the background images paths will be displayed bellow in the Log text area
You can then proceed by pressing the Confirm button and confirming your actions.
Congratulations! All of the backgrounds have been deleted!
(See #TODO and #Known issues for more information or contact me using the contacts bellow :D)


#TODO:
add a system that stores maps instead of deleting them so that you can switch between having backgrounds and not having them

make the auto-search run asynchronosly, so that nothing freezes while it's searching for the osu!/Songs folder

complete the GUI and add other functionality

#Known issues:
When auto searching for the osu folder the app freezes because it doesn't search for the osu!/Songs folder asynchronously
